Playwright supports Chromium, WebKit and Firefox on Windows, Linux and macOS, locally or in CI, headless or headed, with native mobile emulation for Chrome (Android) and Mobile Safari. You will learn How to install Playwright What's installed How to run the example test How to open the HTML test report Installing Playwright ​ Get started by installing Playwright using one of the following methods. Using npm, yarn or pnpm ​ The command below either initializes a new project or adds Playwright to an existing one. npm yarn pnpm npm init playwright@latest yarn create playwright pnpm create playwright When prompted, choose / confirm: TypeScript or JavaScript (default: TypeScript) Tests folder name (default: tests , or e2e if tests already exists) Add a GitHub Actions workflow (recommended for CI) Install Playwright browsers (default: yes) You can re-run the command later; it does not overwrite existing tests. Using the VS Code Extension ​ You can also create and run tests with the VS Code Extension . What's Installed ​ Playwright downloads required browser binaries and creates the scaffold below. playwright.config.ts package.json package-lock.json tests/ example.spec.ts The playwright.config centralizes configuration: target browsers, timeouts, retries, projects, reporters and more. In existing projects dependencies are added to your current package.json . tests/ contains a minimal starter test. Running the Example Test ​ By default tests run headless in parallel across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit (configurable in playwright.config ). Output and aggregated results display in the terminal. npm yarn pnpm npx playwright test yarn playwright test pnpm exec playwright test Tips: See the browser window: add --headed . Run a single project/browser: --project=chromium . Run one file: npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts . Open testing UI: --ui . See Running Tests for details on filtering, headed mode, sharding and retries. HTML Test Reports ​ After a test run, the HTML Reporter provides a dashboard filterable by the browser, passed, failed, skipped, flaky and more. Click a test to inspect errors, attachments and steps. It auto-opens only when failures occur; open manually with the command below. npm yarn pnpm npx playwright show-report yarn playwright show-report pnpm exec playwright show-report Running the Example Test in UI Mode ​ Run tests with UI Mode for watch mode, live step view, time travel debugging and more. npm yarn pnpm npx playwright test --ui yarn playwright test --ui pnpm exec playwright test --ui See the detailed guide on UI Mode for watch filters, step details and trace integration. Updating Playwright ​ Update Playwright and download new browser binaries and their dependencies: npm yarn pnpm npm install -D @playwright/test@latest npx playwright install --with-d",

Full isolation • Fast execution Browser contexts. Playwright creates a browser context for each test. Browser context is equivalent to a brand new browser profile. This delivers full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating a new browser context only takes a handful of milliseconds. Log in once. Save the authentication state of the context and reuse it in all the tests. This bypasses repetitive log-in operations in each test, yet delivers full isolation of independent tests. Powerful Tooling Codegen. Generate tests by recording your actions. Save them into any language. Playwright inspector. Inspect page, generate selectors, step through the test execution, see click points, explore execution logs. Trace Viewer. Capture all the information to investigate the test failure. Playwright trace contains test execution screencast, live DOM snapshots, action explorer, test source, and many more. Chosen by companies and open source projects",
